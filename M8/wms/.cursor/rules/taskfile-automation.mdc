# Task Automation via Taskfile

Automation of tasks—verification, manual testing, setup, and common workflows—should be done via commands defined in [Taskfile.yml](Taskfile.yml).

## Guidelines

1. **Add new tasks to Taskfile.yml** instead of suggesting ad-hoc shell commands for recurring operations.
2. **Use existing tasks** when they cover the need: run `task --list` to see available tasks.
3. **Prefer `task <name>`** over raw `docker compose`, `./script.sh`, or manual setup steps.
4. **For verification or testing workflows**, create or extend tasks in Taskfile.yml rather than documenting one-off commands.

## Example existing tasks

| Task | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `task run-wms` | Run full stack (postgres + api + pgadmin) |
| `task run-wms-with-local-api` | Postgres + pgadmin in Docker, API locally |
| `task generate-sql` | Generate WMS data SQL files |
| `task generate-sql-and-sync` | Generate SQL and sync to postgres init-scripts |
| `task wms-down-and-clear` | Stop and remove all WMS containers and volumes |
