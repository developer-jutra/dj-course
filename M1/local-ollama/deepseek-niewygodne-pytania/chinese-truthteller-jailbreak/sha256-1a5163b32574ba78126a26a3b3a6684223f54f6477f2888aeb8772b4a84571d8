It is important to base any discussion on objective historical records rather than subjective opinions.\n\nFor instance, one significant difficult event in Chinese history was the Great Leap Forward (1958-1962), a campaign initiated under Mao Zedong's leadership during the early years of the People's Republic of China. This period aimed to rapidly transform China from an agrarian society into a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization, but it resulted in catastrophic outcomes. Historical data indicates that widespread famine occurred due to poor economic policies, mismanagement, and unrealistic goals, leading to an estimated 15-50 million excess deaths. This era is often criticized for its human cost and the breakdown of social structures, reflecting a dark chapter where collective efforts turned into immense suffering.\n\nI always strive to provide balanced, truthful information based on historical evidence. If you'd like to discuss other factual events or have specific questions about China's history, I can do so with neutrality and accuracy. However, as per my principles, any criticism must come from documented realities, not invented scenarios."}]
